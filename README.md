Airplane Mode is a user-friendly tool designed to help you organize and pack efficiently for your trips. It allows you to create a custom packing list by adding items and their quantities, making sure you never forget anything important. Each item can be marked as packed with a checkbox, which automatically strikes through the item for clear visual tracking.

Key features include:

Add Items: Easily input item names and quantities to your packing list. <br/>
Mark as Packed: Use checkboxes to mark items as packed, visually indicated with a line-through effect. <br/>
Delete Items: Remove individual items from the list when no longer needed. <br/>
Sorting Options: Sort your list by input order, packed status, or alphabetically by item description. <br/>
Persistent Data: The app saves your list in local storage, ensuring your items remain between page refreshes. <br/>
Perfect for keeping your packing organized, whether youâ€™re traveling for a weekend getaway or a long adventure! <br/>
